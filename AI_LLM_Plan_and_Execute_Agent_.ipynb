In Europe, 39 percent believe AI’s opportunities and risks are broadly balanced, while 24 percent take a negative stance, suggesting the risks outweigh potential benefits.\\n\\nUnderstanding of AI technology also varies significantly by region. While over 80 percent of Chinese respondents claim to understand AI’s use in cars, this figure drops to just 54 percent among European drivers, highlighting a notable knowledge gap.\\n\\nMarcus Willand, Partner at MHP and one of the study’s authors, notes: “The figures show that the prospect of greater safety and comfort due to AI can motivate purchasing decisions. However, the European respondents in particular are often hesitant and price-sensitive.”\\n\\nThe willingness to pay for AI features shows an equally stark divide. Just 23 percent of European drivers expressed willingness to pay for AI functions, compared to 39 percent of Chinese drivers. The study suggests that most users now expect AI features to be standard rather than optional extras.\\n\\nDr Nils Schaupensteiner, Associated Partner at MHP and study co-author, said: “Automotive companies need to create innovations with clear added value and develop both direct and indirect monetisation of their AI offerings, for example through data-based business models and improved services.”\\n\\nIn-vehicle AI opportunities\\n\\nDespite these challenges, traditional automotive manufacturers maintain a trust advantage over tech giants. The study reveals that 64 percent of customers trust established car manufacturers with AI implementation, compared to 50 percent for technology firms like Apple, Google, and Microsoft.\\n\\nThe research identified several key areas where AI could provide significant value across the automotive industry’s value chain, including pattern recognition for quality management, enhanced data management capabilities, AI-driven decision-making systems, and improved customer service through AI-powered communication tools.\\n\\n“It is worth OEMs and suppliers considering the opportunities offered by the new technology along their entire value chain,” explains Augustin Friedel, Senior Manager and study co-author. “However, the possible uses are diverse and implementation is quite complex.”\\n\\nThe study reveals that while up to 79 percent of respondents express interest in AI-powered features such as driver assistance systems, intelligent route planning, and predictive maintenance, manufacturers face significant challenges in monetising these capabilities, particularly in the European market.\\n\\nSee also: MIT breakthrough could transform robot training\\n\\nWant to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?

However, the lack of labelled data for numerous languages poses a significant challenge in developing high-quality machine-learning models.\\n\\nIn response to this problem, the Meta-led Massively Multilingual Speech (MMS) project has made remarkable strides in expanding language coverage and improving the performance of speech recognition and synthesis models.\\n\\nBy combining self-supervised learning techniques with a diverse dataset of religious readings, the MMS project has achieved impressive results in growing the ~100 languages supported by existing speech recognition models to over 1,100 languages.\\n\\nBreaking down language barriers\\n\\nTo address the scarcity of labelled data for most languages, the MMS project utilised religious texts, such as the Bible, which have been translated into numerous languages.\\n\\nThese translations provided publicly available audio recordings of people reading the texts, enabling the creation of a dataset comprising readings of the New Testament in over 1,100 languages.\\n\\nBy including unlabeled recordings of other religious readings, the project expanded language coverage to recognise over 4,000 languages.\\n\\nDespite the dataset’s specific domain and predominantly male speakers, the models performed equally well for male and female voices. Meta also says it did not introduce any religious bias.\\n\\nOvercoming challenges through self-supervised learning\\n\\nTraining conventional supervised speech recognition models with just 32 hours of data per language is inadequate.\\n\\nTo overcome this limitation, the MMS project leveraged the benefits of the wav2vec 2.0 self-supervised speech representation learning technique.\\n\\nBy training self-supervised models on approximately 500,000 hours of speech data across 1,400 languages, the project significantly reduced the reliance on labelled data.\\n\\nThe resulting models were then fine-tuned for specific speech tasks, such as multilingual speech recognition and language identification.\\n\\nImpressive results\\n\\nEvaluation of the models trained on the MMS data revealed impressive results. In a comparison with OpenAI’s Whisper, the MMS models exhibited half the word error rate while covering 11 times more languages.\\n\\nFurthermore, the MMS project successfully built text-to-speech systems for over 1,100 languages. Despite the limitation of having relatively few different speakers for many languages, the speech generated by these systems exhibited high quality.\\n\\nWhile the MMS models have shown promising results, it is essential to acknowledge their imperfections. Mistranscriptions or misinterpretations by the speech-to-text model could result in offensive or inaccurate language. The MMS project emphasises collaboration across the AI community to mitigate such risks.\\n\\nYou can read the MMS paper here or find the project on GitHub.\\n\\nWant to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?

He has expertise in moderating webinars and presenting content on video, in addition to having a background in networking technology.\\n\\nThe combination of artificial intelligence and policymaking can occasionally have unforeseen repercussions, as seen recently in Alaska.\\n\\nIn an unusual turn of events, Alaska legislators reportedly used AI-generated citations that were inaccurate to justify a proposed policy banning cellphones in schools. As reported by /The Alaska Beacon/, Alaska’s Department of Education and Early Development (DEED) presented a policy draft containing references to academic studies that simply did not exist.\\n\\nThe situation arose when Alaska’s Education Commissioner, Deena Bishop, used generative AI to draft the cellphone policy. The document produced by the AI included supposed scholarly references that were neither verified nor accurate, yet the document did not disclose the use of AI in its preparation. Some of the AI-generated content reached the Alaska State Board of Education and Early Development before it could be reviewed, potentially influencing board discussions.\\n\\nCommissioner Bishop later claimed that AI was used only to “create citations” for an initial draft and asserted that she corrected the errors before the meeting by sending updated citations to board members. However, AI “hallucinations”—fabricated information generated when AI attempts to create plausible yet unverified content—were still present in the final document that was voted on by the board.\\n\\nThe final resolution, published on DEED’s website, directs the department to establish a model policy for cellphone restrictions in schools. Unfortunately, the document included six citations, four of which seemed to be from respected scientific journals. However, the references were entirely made up, with URLs that led to unrelated content. The incident shows the risks of using AI-generated data without proper human verification, especially when making policy rulings.\\n\\nAlaska’s case is not one of a kind. AI hallucinations are increasingly common in a variety of professional sectors. For example, some legal professionals have faced consequences for using AI-generated, fictitious case citations in court. Similarly, academic papers created using AI have included distorted data and fake sources, presenting serious credibility concerns. When left unchecked, generative AI algorithms, which are meant to produce content based on patterns rather than factual accuracy, can easily produce misleading citations.\\n\\nThe reliance on AI-generated data in policymaking, particularly in education, carries significant risks. When policies are developed based on fabricated information, they may misallocate resources and potentially harm students. For instance, a policy restricting cellphone use based on fabricated data may divert attention from more effective, evidence-based interventions that could genuinely benefit students.\\n\\nFurthermore, using unverified AI data can erode public trust in both the policymaking process and AI technology itself. Such incidents underscore the importance of fact-checking, transparency, and caution when using AI in sensitive decision-making areas, especially in education, where impact on students can be profound.\\n\\nAlaska officials attempted to downplay the situation, referring to the fabricated citations as “placeholders” intended for later correction. However, the document with the “placeholders” was still presented to the board and used as the basis for a vote, underscoring the need for rigorous oversight when using AI.\\n\\n(Photo by Hartono Creative Studio)\\n\\nSee also: Anthropic urges AI regulation to avoid catastrophes\\n\\nWant to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?

He has expertise in moderating webinars and presenting content on video, in addition to having a background in networking technology.\\n\\nGoogle has big hopes for AI, as evidenced by the consistent improvements to its Gemini chatbot in recent months.\\n\\nGoogle briefly introduced its vision for a “universal AI agent” aimed to help users with daily tasks at the I/O developer conference in May, hinting that elements of the technology could be incorporated into Gemini soon. Recent insights from The Information have shed more light on its initiative, known internally as Project Jarvis.\\n\\nProject Jarvis represents a major advancement in AI for Google. Unlike traditional voice assistants that respond to user commands, Jarvis is designed to perform tasks autonomously, navigate the web, and make independent decisions. For instance, Jarvis could manage emails, conduct research, and even schedule appointments, reducing the cognitive load involved in managing digital tasks.\\n\\nJarvis’s core objective is to revolutionise how users interact with their devices. Rather than serving as a passive tool awaiting commands, Jarvis would actively engage in real-time task management, positioning it as an AI partner rather than a utility.\\n\\nFor legal professionals, Jarvis could review large volumes of case documents and organise them by relevance, streamlining workflow. Similarly, marketers could use Jarvis to integrate data from numerous sources, allowing them to focus more on strategy and less on administrative work.\\n\\nThe evolution of AI agents such as Jarvis may have an impact on specific job roles. Tasks formerly performed by entry-level administrative personnel may come within the capabilities of AI assistants. However, the shift is likely to generate opportunities in roles that require critical thinking, creativity, and emotional intelligence—qualities not easily replicated by AI.\\n\\nIndustry observers anticipate a shift toward higher-value work, with people concentrating less on routine tasks and more on areas that promote innovation and strategic decision-making.\\n\\nPrivacy and security considerations\\n\\nProject Jarvis raises significant privacy and security issues due to its ability to access sensitive information such as emails and documents. To prevent unauthorised access, Google will most likely deploy enhanced encryption, strict user restrictions, and, maybe, multi-factor authentication. Cybersecurity will also be essential to keep Jarvis secure from external threats.\\n\\nSurveys indicate that, while AI holds considerable appeal, privacy remains a top concern for many users. Experts recommend measures such as a transparent privacy dashboard that enables users to monitor and control Jarvis’s access to data. To build trust and drive the adoption of AI agents like Jarvis, Google will need to strike a balance between convenience and robust privacy protections.\\n\\nEnhancing user experience and accessibility\\n\\nBeyond productivity, Jarvis has the potential to improve accessibility for a wide range of users. For those with disabilities, Jarvis could read web content aloud or use voice commands to assist with form navigation. For less tech-savvy users, Jarvis could simplify digital interactions by handling tasks like locating files or managing settings.\\n\\nJarvis could also assist in planning a busy workday or booking a trip by actively supporting task management. Project Jarvis aims to reimagine AI as a supportive digital partner, enhancing the user experience beyond that of a conventional tool.\\n\\n(Photo by Igor Bumba)\\n\\nSee also: Google advances mobile AI in Pixel 9 smartphones\\n\\nWant to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?

Connect with him on X (@gadget_ry) or Mastodon (@gadgetry@techhub.social)\\n\\nAnthropic has flagged the potential risks of AI systems and calls for well-structured regulation to avoid potential catastrophes. The organisation argues that targeted regulation is essential to harness AI’s benefits while mitigating its dangers.\\n\\nAs AI systems evolve in capabilities such as mathematics, reasoning, and coding, their potential misuse in areas like cybersecurity or even biological and chemical disciplines significantly increases.\\n\\nAnthropic warns the next 18 months are critical for policymakers to act, as the window for proactive prevention is narrowing. Notably, Anthropic’s Frontier Red Team highlights how current models can already contribute to various cyber offense-related tasks and expects future models to be even more effective.\\n\\nOf particular concern is the potential for AI systems to exacerbate chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear (CBRN) misuse. The UK AI Safety Institute found that several AI models can now match PhD-level human expertise in providing responses to science-related inquiries.\\n\\nIn addressing these risks, Anthropic has detailed its Responsible Scaling Policy (RSP) that was released in September 2023 as a robust countermeasure. RSP mandates an increase in safety and security measures corresponding to the sophistication of AI capabilities.\\n\\nThe RSP framework is designed to be adaptive and iterative, with regular assessments of AI models allowing for timely refinement of safety protocols. Anthropic says that it’s committed to maintaining and enhancing safety spans various team expansions, particularly in security, interpretability, and trust sectors, ensuring readiness for the rigorous safety standards set by its RSP.\\n\\nAnthropic believes the widespread adoption of RSPs across the AI industry, while primarily voluntary, is essential for addressing AI risks.\\n\\nTransparent, effective regulation is crucial to reassure society of AI companies’ adherence to promises of safety. Regulatory frameworks, however, must be strategic, incentivising sound safety practices without imposing unnecessary burdens.\\n\\nAnthropic envisions regulations that are clear, focused, and adaptive to evolving technological landscapes, arguing that these are vital in achieving a balance between risk mitigation and fostering innovation.\\n\\nIn the US, Anthropic suggests that federal legislation could be the ultimate answer to AI risk regulation—though state-driven initiatives might need to step in if federal action lags. Legislative frameworks developed by countries worldwide should allow for standardisation and mutual recognition to support a global AI safety agenda, minimising the cost of regulatory adherence across different regions.\\n\\nFurthermore, Anthropic addresses scepticism towards imposing regulations—highlighting that overly broad use-case-focused regulations would be inefficient for general AI systems, which have diverse applications. Instead, regulations should target fundamental properties and safety measures of AI models.\\n\\nWhile covering broad risks, Anthropic acknowledges that some immediate threats – like deepfakes – aren’t the focus of their current proposals since other initiatives are tackling these nearer-term issues.\\n\\nUltimately, Anthropic stresses the importance of instituting regulations that spur innovation rather than stifle it. The initial compliance burden, though inevitable, can be minimised through flexible and carefully-designed safety tests. Proper regulation can even help safeguard both national interests and private sector innovation by securing intellectual property against threats internally and externally.\\n\\nBy focusing on empirically measured risks, Anthropic plans for a regulatory landscape that neither biases against nor favours open or closed-source models. The objective remains clear: to manage the significant risks of frontier AI models with rigorous but adaptable regulation.\\n\\n(Image Credit: Anthropic)\\n\\nSee also: President Biden issues first National Security Memorandum on AI\\n\\nWant to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?

Since Copilot’s initial release, this three-pronged update represents GitHub’s most ambitious AI toolkit expansion.\\n\\nEnhanced model support for Copilot\\n\\nGitHub Copilot has long leveraged different large language models (LLMs) for various use cases. The first public version of Copilot was launched using Codex, an early version of OpenAI GPT-3, specifically fine-tuned for coding tasks. Copilot Chat was launched in 2023 with GPT-3.5 and later GPT-4.\\n\\n“Since then, we have updated the base model versions multiple times, using a range from GPT 3.5-turbo to GPT 4o and 4o-mini models for different latency and quality requirements,” Thomas Dohmke, GitHub’s CEO, said in a blog write-up.\\n\\nGitHub’s decision to extend Copilot’s model support beyond OpenAI’s technology represents a notable evolution in its AI-assisted development strategy. The integration now includes models from industry leaders Anthropic and Google, alongside OpenAI, providing developers access to a broader range of AI capabilities.\\n\\nThe multi-model approach suggests GitHub’s commitment to offering developers more choice and flexibility in their AI-assisted coding journey.\\n\\n“We are bringing developer choice to GitHub Copilot with Anthropic’s Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Google’s Gemini 1.5 Pro, and OpenAI’s o1-preview and o1-mini. These new models will be rolling out—first in Copilot Chat, with OpenAI o1-preview and o1-mini available now, Claude 3.5 Sonnet rolling out progressively over the next week, and Google’s Gemini 1.5 Pro in the coming weeks. From Copilot Workspace to multi-file editing to code review, security autofix, and the CLI, we will bring multi-model choices across many of GitHub Copilot’s surface areas and functions soon,” the CEO said.\\n\\nGitHub’s expansion of model support is particularly significant as it allows developers to leverage different AI models’ strengths for various coding tasks. Each AI provider brings its own capabilities and specialisations, which could lead to more accurate and context-aware code suggestions across different programming languages and frameworks.\\n\\nGitHub Spark: Natural language web development\\n\\nHowever, the company’s most intriguing announcement is the introduction of GitHub Spark, a new tool designed to revolutionise web application development and achieve GitHub’s vision of reaching one billion developers. Spark enables developers to build web applications using natural language instructions, potentially reducing the complexity and time required for web development projects.\\n\\nThis natural language approach to web development could particularly benefit:\\n\\nDevelopers looking to rapidly prototype applications,\\n\\nTeams seeking to bridge the gap between design concepts and implementation,\\n\\nOrganisations aiming to accelerate their web development lifecycle.\\n\\nCopilot arrives on Apple’s Xcode\\n\\nThe recent release of Copilot for Apple’s Xcode in public preview form represents another milestone in GitHub’s expansion strategy.

This framework defines what open-source AI means, insisting that the same open-source requirements apply whether to a fully functional AI system, a model, weights and parameters, or other structural elements.\\n\\nAn open-source AI system must be made available under terms that grant four essential freedoms:\\n\\nUse the system for any purpose and without having to ask for permission.\\n\\nand without having to ask for permission. Study how the system works and inspect its components.\\n\\nand inspect its components. Modify the system for any purpose, including to change its output.\\n\\nfor any purpose, including to change its output. Share the system for others to use with or without modifications, for any purpose.\\n\\nThese freedoms apply both to a fully functional system and to discrete elements of a system. A precondition to exercising these freedoms is having access to the preferred form to make modifications to the system, which includes detailed data information, complete source code, and model parameters.\\n\\n“The co-design process that led to version 1.0 of the Open Source AI Definition was well-developed, thorough, inclusive, and fair,” said Carlo Piana, OSI board chair. “The board is confident that the process has resulted in a definition that meets the standards of open-source as defined in the open-source definition and the four essential freedoms.”\\n\\nOne of the framework’s most significant requirements is the mandate for open-source models to provide sufficient information about their training data, ensuring that “a skilled person can recreate a substantially equivalent system using the same or similar data,” according to Ayah Bdeir, who leads AI strategy at Mozilla.\\n\\nBdeir acknowledged that whilst this approach might not be perfect, it represents a practical compromise between ideological purity and real-world implementation. She suggested that demanding an unrealistically high standard could prove counterproductive to the initiative’s goals.\\n\\nThe Digital Public Goods Alliance (DPGA) has expressed support for the OSI’s leadership in defining open-source AI. Liv Marte Nordhaug, CEO of the DPGA secretariat, confirmed that her organisation will incorporate this foundational work into updates to their Digital Public Goods Standard for AI applications.\\n\\nEleutherAI Institute, known for its non-profit work in AI development, has also endorsed the definition.\\n\\n“The Open Source AI Definition is a necessary step towards promoting the benefits of open-source principles in the field of AI,” stated Stella Biderman, Executive Director of the EleutherAI Institute. “We believe that this definition supports the needs of independent machine learning researchers and promotes greater transparency among the largest AI developers.”\\n\\nThe definition highlights the importance of including data information and code when sharing open-source models and weights. These requirements ensure transparency and the ability to modify the AI system.\\n\\nOSI Executive Director Stefano Maffulli acknowledged the challenges faced during the development process, noting that despite occasional heated exchanges and differing opinions, the final result aligned with the project’s initial objectives.\\n\\n“This is a starting point for a continued effort to engage with the communities to improve the definition over time,” he stated.\\n\\nThe OSAID does not require a specific legal mechanism for assuring that model parameters are freely available to all, though it may involve licences or legal instruments. This aspect is expected to become clearer over time as the legal system addresses these open-source AI systems.\\n\\nSee also: President Biden issues first National Security Memorandum on AI\\n\\nWant to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?

Connect with him on X (@gadget_ry) or Mastodon (@gadgetry@techhub.social)\\n\\nMIT researchers have developed a robot training method that reduces time and cost while improving adaptability to new tasks and environments.\\n\\nThe approach – called Heterogeneous Pretrained Transformers (HPT) – combines vast amounts of diverse data from multiple sources into a unified system, effectively creating a shared language that generative AI models can process. This method marks a significant departure from traditional robot training, where engineers typically collect specific data for individual robots and tasks in controlled environments.\\n\\nLead researcher Lirui Wang – an electrical engineering and computer science graduate student at MIT – believes that while many cite insufficient training data as a key challenge in robotics, a bigger issue lies in the vast array of different domains, modalities, and robot hardware. Their work demonstrates how to effectively combine and utilise all these diverse elements.\\n\\nThe research team developed an architecture that unifies various data types, including camera images, language instructions, and depth maps. HPT utilises a transformer model, similar to those powering advanced language models, to process visual and proprioceptive inputs.\\n\\nIn practical tests, the system demonstrated remarkable results—outperforming traditional training methods by more than 20 per cent in both simulated and real-world scenarios. This improvement held true even when robots encountered tasks significantly different from their training data.\\n\\nThe researchers assembled an impressive dataset for pretraining, comprising 52 datasets with over 200,000 robot trajectories across four categories. This approach allows robots to learn from a wealth of experiences, including human demonstrations and simulations.\\n\\nOne of the system’s key innovations lies in its handling of proprioception (the robot’s awareness of its position and movement.) The team designed the architecture to place equal importance on proprioception and vision, enabling more sophisticated dexterous motions.\\n\\nLooking ahead, the team aims to enhance HPT’s capabilities to process unlabelled data, similar to advanced language models. Their ultimate vision involves creating a universal robot brain that could be downloaded and used for any robot without additional training.\\n\\nWhile acknowledging they are in the early stages, the team remains optimistic that scaling could lead to breakthrough developments in robotic policies, similar to the advances seen in large language models.\\n\\nYou can find a copy of the researchers’ paper here (PDF)\\n\\n(Photo by Possessed Photography)\\n\\nSee also: Jailbreaking AI robots: Researchers sound alarm over security flaws\\n\\nWant to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?

Under his leadership, publications have been praised by analyst firms such as Forrester for their excellence and performance. Connect with him on X (@gadget_ry) or Mastodon (@gadgetry@techhub.social)\\n\\nPresident Biden has issued the US’ first-ever National Security Memorandum (NSM) on AI, addressing how the nation approaches the technology from a security perspective.\\n\\nThe memorandum, which builds upon Biden’s earlier executive order on AI, is founded on the premise that cutting-edge AI developments will substantially impact national security and foreign policy in the immediate future.\\n\\nSecurity experts suggest the implications are already being felt. “AI already has implications for national security, as we know that more and more attackers are using AI to create higher volume and more complex attacks, especially in the social engineering and misinformation fronts,” says Melissa Ruzzi, Director of AI at AppOmni.\\n\\nAt its core, the NSM outlines three primary objectives: establishing US leadership in safe AI development, leveraging AI technologies for national security, and fostering international governance frameworks.\\n\\n“Our competitors want to upend US AI leadership and have employed economic and technological espionage in efforts to steal US technology,” the memorandum states, elevating the protection of American AI innovations to a “top-tier intelligence priority.”\\n\\nThe document formally designates the AI Safety Institute as the primary governmental point of contact for the AI industry. This institute will be staffed with technical experts and will maintain close partnerships with national security agencies, including the intelligence community, Department of Defence, and Department of Energy.\\n\\n“The actions listed in the memo are great starting points to get a good picture of the status quo and obtain enough information to make decisions based on data, instead of jumping to conclusions to make decisions based on vague assumptions,” Ruzzi explains.\\n\\nHowever, Ruzzi cautions that “the data that needs to be collected on the actions is not trivial, and even with the data, assumptions and trade-offs will be necessary for final decision making. Making decisions after data gathering is where the big challenge will be.”\\n\\nIn a notable move to democratise AI research, the memorandum reinforces support for the National AI Research Resource pilot programme. This initiative aims to extend AI research capabilities beyond major tech firms to universities, civil society organisations, and small businesses.\\n\\nThe NSM introduces the Framework to Advance AI Governance and Risk Management in National Security (PDF), which establishes comprehensive guidelines for implementing AI in national security applications. These guidelines mandate rigorous risk assessment procedures and safeguards against privacy invasions, bias, discrimination, and human rights violations.\\n\\nSecurity considerations feature prominently in the framework, with Ruzzi emphasising their importance: “Cybersecurity of AI is crucial – we know that if AI is misconfigured, it can pose risks similar to misconfigurations in SaaS applications that cause confidential data to be exposed.”\\n\\nOn the international front, the memorandum builds upon recent diplomatic achievements, including the G7’s International Code of Conduct on AI and agreements reached at the Bletchley and Seoul AI Safety Summits. Notably, 56 nations have endorsed the US-led Political Declaration on the Military Use of AI and Autonomy.\\n\\nThe Biden administration has also secured a diplomatic victory with the passage of the first UN General Assembly Resolution on AI, which garnered unanimous support, including co-sponsorship from China.\\n\\nThe memorandum emphasises the critical role of semiconductor manufacturing in AI development, connecting to Biden’s earlier CHIPS Act. It directs actions to enhance chip supply chain security and diversity, ensuring American leadership in advanced computing infrastructure.\\n\\nThis latest initiative forms part of the Biden-Harris Administration’s broader strategy for responsible innovation in the AI sector, reinforcing America’s commitment to maintaining technological leadership while upholding democratic values and human rights.\\n\\n(Photo by Nils Huenerfuerst)\\n\\nSee also: EU AI Act: Early prep could give businesses competitive edge\\n\\nWant to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?

              "  'text': 'Influencer partnerships can be great for brands looking to pump out content that promotes their products and services in an authentic way. These types of engagements can yield significant brand awareness and brand sentiment lift, but they can be risky too. Social media stars are unpredictable at the best of times, with many deliberately chasing controversy to increase their fame.\\n\\nThese antics don’t always reflect well on the brands that collaborate with especially attention-hungry influencers, leaving marketers no choice but to conduct careful due diligence on the individuals they work with. Luckily, that task can be made much easier thanks to the evolving utility of AI.\\n\\nLightricks, a software company best known for its AI-powered video and image editing tools, is once again expanding the AI capabilities of its suite with this week’s announcement of SafeCollab. An AI-powered influencer vetting module that lives within the company’s Popular Pays creator collaboration platform, SafeCollab is a new tool for marketers that automates the vetting process.\\n\\nTraditionally, marketers have had no choice but to spend hours researching the backgrounds of influencers, looking through years’ worth of video uploads and social media posts. It’s a lengthy, manual process that can only be automated with intelligent tools.\\n\\nSafeCollab provides that intelligence with its underlying large language models, which do the job of investigating influencers to ensure the image they portray is consistent with brand values. The LLMs perform what amounts to a risk assessment of creators’ content across multiple social media channels in minutes, searching through hours of videos, audio uploads, images and text.\\n\\nIn doing this, SafeCollab significantly reduces the time it takes for brand marketers to perform due diligence on the social media influencers they’re considering partnering with. Likewise, when creators opt in to SafeCollab, they make it easier for marketers to understand the brand safety implications of working together, reducing friction from campaign lifecycles.\\n\\nBrands can’t take chances\\n\\nThe idea here is to empower brand marketers to avoid working with creators whose content is not aligned with the brand’s values – as well as those who have a tendency to kick up a storm.\\n\\nSuch due diligence is vital, for even the most innocuous influencers can have some skeletons in their closets. A case in point is the popular lifestyle influencer Brooke Schofield, who has more than 2.2 million followers on TikTok and co-hosts the “Canceled” podcast on YouTube. With her large following, good looks and keen sense of fashion, Schofield looked like a great fit for the clothing brand Boys Lie, which collaborated with her on an exclusive capsule collection called “Bless His Heart.”\\n\\nHowever, Boys Lie quickly came to regret its collaboration with Schofield when a scandal erupted in April after fans unearthed a number of years-old social media posts where she expressed racist views.\\n\\nThe posts, which were uploaded on X between 2012 and 2015 when Schofield was a teenager, contained a string of racist profanities and insulting jokes about Black people’s hairstyles. In one post, she vigorously defended George Zimmerman, a white American who was controversially acquitted of the murder of the Black teenager Trayvon Martin.\\n\\nSchofield apologized profusely for her posts, admitting that they were “very hurtful” while stressing that she’s a changed person, having had time to “learn and grow and formulate my own opinions.”\\n\\nHowever, Boys Lie decided it had no option but to drop its association with Schofield. After a statement on Instagram saying it’s “working on a solution,” the company followed by quietly withdrawing the clothing collection they had previously collaborated on.\\n\\nAccelerating due diligence\\n\\nIf the marketing team at Boys Lie had access to a tool like SafeCollab, they likely would have uncovered Schofield’s controversial posts long before commissioning the collaboration. The tool, which is a part of Lightricks’ influencer marketing platform Popular Pays, is all about helping brands to automate their due diligence processes when working with social media creators.\\n\\nBy analyzing years of creators’ histories of posts across platforms like Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube, it can check everything they’ve posted online to make sure there’s nothing that might reflect badly on a brand.\\n\\nBrands can define their risk parameters, and the tool will quickly generate an accurate risk assessment evaluation, so they can confidently choose the influencers they want to work with, safe in the knowledge that their partnerships are unlikely to spark any backlash.\\n\\nWithout a platform like SafeCollab, the task of performing all of this due diligence falls on the shoulders of marketers, and that means spending hours trawling through each influencer’s profiles, checking everything and anything they’ve ever said or done to ensure there’s nothing in their past that the brand would rather not be associated with.\\n\\nWhen we consider that the scope of work might include audio voiceovers, extensive comment threads and frame-by-frame analyses of video content, it’s a painstaking process that never really ends. After all, the top influencers have a habit of churning out fresh content every day. Careful marketers have no choice but to continuously monitor what they’re posting.\\n\\nBeyond initial history scans, SafeCollab’s real-time monitoring algorithms assume full responsibility, generating instant alerts to any problematic content, such as posts that contain graphic language, inappropriate images, promote violence or drug and alcohol use, mention violence, or whatever else the brand deems to be unsavory.\\n\\nAI’s expanding applications\\n\\nWith the launch of SafeCollab, Lightricks is demonstrating yet another use case for generative AI. The company first made a name for itself as a developer of AI-powered video and image editing apps, including Photoleap, Facetune and Videoleap.\\n\\nThe latter app incorporates AI-powered video filters and text-to-video generative AI functionalities. It also boasts an AI Effects feature, where users can apply specialized AI art styles to achieve the desired vibe for each video they create.\\n\\nLightricks is also the company behind LTX Studio, which is a comprehensive platform that helps advertising production firms and filmmakers to create storyboards and asset-rich pitch decks for their video projects using text-to-video generative AI.\\n\\nWith all of Lightricks’ AI apps, the primary benefit is that they save users time by automating manual work and bringing creative visions to life, and SafeCollab is a great example of that. By automating the due diligence process from start to finish, marketers can quickly identify controversial influencers they’d rather steer clear of, without spending hours conducting exhaustive research.'},\n",

              "  'text': 'As a tech journalist, Zul focuses on topics including cloud computing, cybersecurity, and disruptive technology in the enterprise industry. He has expertise in moderating webinars and presenting content on video, in addition to having a background in networking technology.\\n\\nByteDance, the creator of TikTok, recently experienced a security breach involving an intern who allegedly sabotaged AI model training. The incident, reported on WeChat, raised concerns about the company’s security protocols in its AI department.\\n\\nIn response, ByteDance clarified that while the intern disrupted AI commercialisation efforts, no online operations or commercial projects were affected. According to the company, rumours that over 8,000 GPU cards were affected and that the breach resulted in millions of dollars in losses are taken out of proportion.\\n\\nThe real issue here goes beyond one rogue intern—it highlights the need for stricter security measures in tech companies, especially when interns are entrusted with key responsibilities. Even minor mistakes in high-pressure environments can have serious consequences.\\n\\nOn investigating, ByteDance found that the intern, a doctoral student, was part of the commercialisation tech team, not the AI Lab. The individual was dismissed in August.\\n\\nAccording to the local media outlet Jiemian, the intern became frustrated with resource allocation and retaliated by exploiting a vulnerability in the AI development platform Hugging Face. This led to disruptions in model training, though ByteDance’s commercial Doubao model was not affected.\\n\\nDespite the disruption, ByteDance’s automated machine learning (AML) team initially struggled to identify the cause. Fortunately, the attack only impacted internal models, minimising broader damage.\\n\\nAs context, China’s AI market, estimated to be worth $250 billion in 2023, is rapidly increasing in size, with industry leaders such as Baidu AI Cloud, SenseRobot, and Zhipu AI driving innovation. However, incidents like this one pose a huge risk to the commercialisation of AI technology, as model accuracy and reliability are directly related to business success.\\n\\nThe situation also raises questions about intern management in tech companies. Interns often play crucial roles in fast-paced environments, but without proper oversight and security protocols, their roles can pose risks. Companies must ensure that interns receive adequate training and supervision to prevent unintentional or malicious actions that could disrupt operations.\\n\\nImplications for AI commercialisation\\n\\nThe security breach highlights the possible risks to AI commercialisation. A disruption in AI model training, such as this one, can cause delays in product releases, loss of client trust, and even financial losses. For a company like ByteDance, where AI drives core functionalities, these kinds of incidents are particularly damaging.\\n\\nThe issue emphasises the importance of ethical AI development and business responsibility. Companies must not only develop cutting-edge AI technology, but also ensure their security and operate responsible management. Transparency and accountability are critical for retaining trust in an era when AI plays an important role in business operations.\\n\\n(Photo by Jonathan Kemper)\\n\\nSee also: Microsoft gains major AI client as TikTok spends $20 million monthly\\n\\nWant to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?
